### How to run the project in development mode
* Clone or download repository as a zip file.
* Open project in Android Studio.
* Run 'app' `SHIFT+F10`.

#### Android Studio IDE setup 
Compose-ShoppingList uses [ktlint](https://ktlint.github.io/) to enforce Kotlin coding styles.
Here's how to configure it for use with Android Studio (instructions adapted from the ktlint [README](https://github.com/shyiko/ktlint/blob/master/README.md)):
* Close Android Studio if it's open
* Download ktlint using these [installation instructions](https://github.com/shyiko/ktlint/blob/master/README.md#installation)    
* Inside the project root directory run: `./ktlint --apply-to-idea-project --android`    
* Remove ktlint if desired: `rm ktlint`
* Start Android Studio
